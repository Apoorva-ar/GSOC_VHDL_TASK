# GSOC_VHDL_TASK2 : UART-SPI bridge
Qualification VHDL task for GSOC 2020 Project: Bidirectional packet protocol for FPGA communication
Repository contain 5 vhdl files : (1) SPI master (2)SPI clock gen (3) SPI data path (4) UART (5) Top level SPI_UART bridge
The top vhdl entity "UART_SPI_Bridge" of bridge.vhd file is able to perform SPI transactions via UART bus.
